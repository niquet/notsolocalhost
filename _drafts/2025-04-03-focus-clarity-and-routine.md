- Perfection has always felt like an impossible standard—especially as someone who is neurodivergent
- For years, I measured my growth against unrealistic expectations, constantly feeling like I was falling short
- But over time, I’ve learned that self-improvement isn’t about flawless execution or meeting society’s rigid definitions of success
- It’s about progress: the small, meaningful steps we take every day to become a better version of ourselves.

---

- In this post, I want to share my journey of embracing progress over perfection and how shifting my mindset has helped me grow in ways I never thought possible.
- Whether you’re neurodivergent like me or simply trying to navigate your own path to self-betterment, I hope this serves as a reminder that every step forward—no matter how small—is worth celebrating.

---

- Perfectionism can feel like a relentless pursuit—an endless chase for flawless outcomes that often leaves us drained, frustrated, and stuck.
- But what if we shifted our focus? What if, instead of striving for unattainable perfection, we celebrated the small wins and steady progress that move us forward?

---

- Choosing progress over perfection isn’t about settling for less; it’s about recognizing the power of incremental growth, learning from mistakes, and taking action even when things aren’t perfect.
- In this post, I’ll explore how embracing this mindset has transformed my approach to personal growth and why progress—no matter how imperfect—is always worth celebrating.

Practical Strategies for Improved Focus

---

Environment and Structure

- Create a structured environment free from distractions
- Identify and minimize common distractions (turn off notifications, use website blockers)
- Maintain a clutter-free workspace
- Consider noise-cancelling headphones or white noise machines for auditory sensitivity

---

Time Management

- Use timers and alarms to create structured work periods with designated breaks
- Implement the Pomodoro Technique (25-minute focused work intervals with short breaks)
- Break large tasks into smaller, manageable steps
- Prioritize tasks based on deadlines and importance

---

Physical Tools and Techniques

- Utilize fidget toys to channel excess energy and improve focus
- Take regular movement breaks with short bursts of physical activity
- Use visual aids like color-coded labels or sticky notes
- Stay hydrated throughout the day
- Maintain regular exercise, particularly cardio workouts
- Ensure quality sleep by creating an optimal sleeping environment
- Follow a balanced diet, avoiding processed foods and sugary drinks

---

Mental Techniques

- Practice meditation to enhance self-awareness and train your mind to refocus when distracted
- Try "wide-angle vision" techniques (similar to Hakalau Meditation) to take in more information while remaining calm
- Take "inspiration walks" where you let your mind wander to enhance creativity and make novel connections between ideas

---

- Brain dumping and journaling are powerful techniques that can significantly improve your attention, focus, and overall cognitive function
- These practices help clear mental clutter, allowing your mind to operate more efficiently

---

Brain Dumping

- Brain dumping involves transferring all your thoughts, ideas, worries, and tasks from your mind onto paper or a digital device
- This cognitive technique helps you:
    - Improve mental clarity and focus
    - Reduce stress and anxiety
    - Enhance concentration
    - Increase productivity
    - Promote emotional well-being
- The process is simple: find a quiet space, grab your preferred writing tool, and write down everything occupying your mental space without worrying about organization or perfection
- This frees up mental bandwidth and gives you a clearer perspective on priorities
- Types of brain dumps:
    - Morning Brain Dump: Start your day by writing down tasks, thoughts, and lingering worries to declutter your mind and organize your day
    - Timed Brain Dump: Set a timer for 2-5 minutes and write everything in your head during that time. Perfect for when you're distracted mid-task or need a quick mental refres
    - Themed Brain Dump: Focus on a specific area (work project, personal problem) using guiding prompts to dive deeper into particular issues
    - Gratitude Brain Dump: Set a timer for 10 minutes and write down everything you feel grateful for
- Benefits of brain dumping
    - Clearing mental clutter: Offloading thoughts frees up cognitive resources for better focus
    - Reducing distractions: By documenting racing thoughts, you can stop them from interrupting your concentration
    - Improving organization: Seeing all your thoughts allows you to logically reorganize and prioritize them
    - Enhancing working memory: The act of writing reinforces neural connections and improves information retention

---

- While brain dumping is often a quick thought-clearing exercise, journaling can be more structured and reflective
- Regular journaling:
    - Strengthens memory and recall
    - Improves problem-solving abilities
    - Breaks through creative blocks
    - Helps make unexpected connections between ideas

---

Practical tips for journaling

- Keep it simple: Don't worry about perfect grammar or organization—just get your thoughts out
- Be consistent: Schedule regular brain dumps (daily or weekly) to make it a habit
- Try different environments: A change in setting can inspire new insights and perspectives
- Experiment with formats: Test both paper and digital methods to see what works best for you
- Be honest: The more truthful you are in your writing, the more beneficial it will be
- Keep your journal accessible: Having it nearby encourages you to capture thoughts throughout the day

- As a neurodivergent person seeking to optimize your cognitive function, here's a structured approach designed specifically for your brain to work with

---

Daily routines

- Morning Brain Dump: Start each day by writing down all thoughts, worries, and tasks to clear mental space
- Establish consistent wake/sleep times to regulate your circadian rhythm
- Create a structured daily schedule with designated times for focused work, breaks, and rest
- Set timers for work periods (try the Pomodoro Technique with 25-minute focused sessions)
- Take movement breaks between tasks (quick stretches, jumping jacks, or a short walk)
- Practice mindfulness for 5-10 minutes daily to enhance self-awareness and attention

---

Environment Setup

- Identify and eliminate distractions in your workspace (notifications, clutter, noise)
- Use noise-cancelling headphones or white noise machines for auditory sensitivity
- Create a designated, clutter-free workspace with minimal visual distractions
- Utilize fidget tools (spinners, stress balls) to channel excess energy while working
- Keep your environment sensory-friendly based on your specific needs

---

Task Management

- Break large tasks into smaller, manageable steps with clear completion criteria
- Use visual aids like color-coded calendars, sticky notes, or mind maps
- Prioritize tasks based on importance and deadlines

Focus Enhancement

- Try the "Five Senses" technique when learning new information (engage multiple senses)
- Use elaborative rehearsal by connecting new information to your interests or existing knowledge
- Create songs, jingles, or rhymes for information you need to remember
