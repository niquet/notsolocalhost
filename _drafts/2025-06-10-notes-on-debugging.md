- Systematic approach, focused on understanding (how to fix it _and_ how to be sure it's fixed)
- Nicole Tietz-Sokolskaya's approach to debugging:
    1. Figure out the symptoms
    2. Reproduce the bug
    3. Understand the system(s)
    4. Form a hypothesis about where the bug is
    5. Test this hypothesis, and repeat if needed
    6. Fix the bug, check the fix, repeat if needed
- **Figure out the symptoms**
    - Understand what behavior you're trying to address
    - Play around with the software in question as well
    - Questions to ask:
        - When did the bug start happening?
        - How many people have experienced it? Reported it?
        - Who noticed it first?
        - What environments does it occur in?
        - What's the bad behavior that's being read as a bug?
        - What behaviors are happening that shouldn't?
        - What's going wrong?
- **Reproduce the bug**
