    - Scope: Tasks or smaller projects
    - Guidance: Works with some guidance
    - Getting things done: Seeks help when stuck
- Getting things done, reliably: Good at breaking down work, realistic estimates, autonomous in unblocking yourself, deliver quality work
- Approaches to growing as a reliable developer:
    - Focus on the most important piece of work
    - Unblock yourself
    - Break down the work
    - Estimate the duration of work
    - Seek out mentors
    - Keep your "goodwill balance" topped up
    - Take the initiative

### Focus on the Most Important Piece of Work

- What is the most important work; the single most important task on your list?
- If you could do one thing this week, what would it be?
- Your answer is your #1 priority
- When you identify it, make sure you definitely, absolutely deliver that piece of work within the agreed timeframe
- Make a habit of always completing your #1 priority
- Even if it means turning down other tasks, skipping meetings, pushing back on other matters
- If you consistently deliver the most important work as expected by your manager and team, you'll be seen as a reliable developer who gets things done
- Learn to say "no": balancing everything is manageable, until there's so much on your plate that you have no time to work on the most important stuff
