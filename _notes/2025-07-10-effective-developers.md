- Notes on getting things done from Gergely Orosz's book "The Software Engineer's Guidebook"
- Different chapters of "Part II: The Competent Software Developer"
- Plus personal experience

## Overview

- Getting things done reliably: good at breaking down work, estimation, autonomous unblocking, deliver quality work
- Reliable developers:
  - Focus on the most important piece of work
  - Unblock themselves
  - Break down the work
  - Estimate the duration of work
  - Seek out mentors
  - Keep "goodwill balance" topped up
  - Take the initiative

## Focus on the most important piece of work

- It's easy to get overwhelmed and feel like you're not making progress
- Simplify your work life
- Ask what is the most important work; the single most important task on your list?
- If you could only do one thing this week, what would it be?
- Your answer is your #1 priority
- When you identify it, ame sure to definitely, absolutely deliver that piece of work within the agreed timeframe

Make a habit of always completing your #1 priority

- Make sure it always gets done, event if it means turning down other tasks, skipping meetings, and pushing back on other matters
- If you consistently deliver the most important work as expected by your manager and team, you'll be seen as a reliable developer who gets things done
- Saying no is sometimes necessary
- Decline requests respectfully
- You don't need to turn down ecerything, but when you're at risk of not completing your #1 priority task, then do say "no" / "yes, I'd love to help, BUT ..."

## Unblock yourself

- Building software often has unforeseen obstacles
- Thousands of things you stumble upon that must be solved before progressing further
- Blockers are more often than not not technology problems
- Reliable software engineers are able to solve blockers faster than colleagues
- _How can you get better at unblocking yourself?_
  - Know when you're blocked: productive engineers catch themselves and admit they're stuck
  - Rule of thumb for catching yourself being blocked: if you go more than 30 minutes without meaningful progress (an hour at most) admit you're blocked
  - Try different unblocking approaches:
    - Rubber-ducking (explain your problem and the approaches already tried out loud)
    - Draw out the problem on a pieace of paper (visualize it)
    - Read documentation and references (there could be a solution for the problem)
    - Search online for similar problems (describe your problem in various ways, others mught have used different terms for the same issue)
    - Post a question, check sites like StackOverflow or other relevant forums (explaining the problem you have can also give you additional ideas on how to solve it)
    - Take a break (go for a walk, switch to an unrelated task; you come back with fresh eyes, might notic something you missed earlier)
    - Start from scratch, or undo all changes (go back to the last point at which the code worked and restart by making small changes, one at a time)

## Break down the work

Think about high-level, tasks, and subtasks

- What are the main pieces of work (_chunks_)?
- Once you have identified chunks, break them down again into tasks which are straightforward
- If needed, divide complex tasks into subtasks
- The easier it is to understand what needs to be done, the easier it is to estimate how long it will take
- Break down the work into small parts, and then challenge yourself to make them even smaller
- A good time to stop breaking things down is when the tasks are clear enough to you

Prioritize work which gets you closer to shipping something

- Focus on an order of work (tasks) that gets you closer to working functionality
- The sooner you have something you can test end-to-end, the sooner you can get feedback on whether you're on the right path
- Once you have a basic case in working order, decide the next priority, and which tasks you need to solve to achieve it

Add, remove and change tasks

- Remember your goal (build software that solves problems, not to close tasks)
- Tasks are just a tool for organizing work
- Use this tool, be ruthless in changing and adding tasks as needed, or removing redundant ones
