# Ctrl+Alt+Collaborate: Hybrid Mob Programming for a Professional Book Club

Tips

- Use a timer for smooth role transitions during mob programming
- For remote participants, use collaborative coding platforms or screen sharing
- Create a supportive environment where questions and mistakes are welcomed

Best practices

- Use clear, simple instructions for all activities, providing them in both written and verbal formats
- Ensure proper audio and video setup for all participants to be seen and heard clearly
- Encourage the use of individual devices and headphones to minimize audio interference
- Alternate between activities that leverage the strengths of both in-person and online participation
- Incorporate individual reflection time before group discussions to enhance learning

Preparation

- Ensure all participants have access to the necessary tools and software
- Set up a single source of truth (e.g., a shared document) for session information, links, and schedule

Approach

- Use a "hub-and-spoke" or "hub and satellite" configuration, depending on your participants' locations
- Shared screen visible to both in-person and remote participants
- Rotate roles every 10-15 minutes
  - Driver: types the code
  - Navigator: guides the coding process
  - Mob: contributes ideas and suggestions

  - Break into pairs or small groups
  - Assign different exercises to each group
- Recap and discussion (20 minutes)
  - Each group shares solutions, challenges
  - Discuss any difficult concepts, alternative approaches
  - Use shared online whiteboards or documents to capture insights and code snippets
