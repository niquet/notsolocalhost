Welcome to my corner of the internet—ain't it fun to be off localhost?

Here you'll find notes that probably interest future-me more than anyone else.<br>
I like to go deep—so don't expect frequent posts. I also break things occasionally that I have to fix.

Everything here reflects my personal opinions only. No paid content, no guest posts, no affiliate links.

A few things to live by:

- **Be persistent.** Most problems are solvable.
- **Keep it simple.** Complexity always sneaks in—fight it.
- **Break things, learn from it.** Make mistakes. Iterate. Improve.
- **Progress over perfection.** Shipping > sitting. Small wins add up.
- **Share your work.** Even if it’s mostly for future-you.
