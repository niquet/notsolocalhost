Ask yourself these questions to gauge your current level:

- Do other engineers seek your input on technical decisions?
- Can you onboard new team members effectively?
- Do you catch and prevent bugs before they reach production?
- Are you comfortable taking ownership of critical system components?
- Do you contribute ideas that improve team processes and productivity?

## Technical Competencies

Code Quality and Craftsmanship

- [ ] You write clean, readable, and maintainable code that follows established conventions
- [ ] Your code is well-documented with clear comments and meaningful variable names
- [ ] You understand and apply design patterns appropriately
- [ ] You can debug complex issues systematically and efficiently
- [ ] Your solutions are scalable and consider performance implications

Problem-solving Abilities

- [ ] You can break down complex problems into manageable components
- [ ] You research and evaluate multiple approaches before implementing solutions
- [ ] You anticipate edge cases and handle errors gracefully
- [ ] You can work effectively with legacy code and refactor when necessary

Technical Proficiency

- [ ] You have deep knowledge in your primary programming languages and frameworks
- [ ] You stay current with industry trends and best practices
- [ ] You can learn new technologies quickly when projects require them
- [ ] You understand fundamental computer science concepts (algorithms, data structures, databases)

## Professional Practices

Collaboration and Communication

- [ ] You work well in team environments and contribute positively to group dynamics
- [ ] You can explain technical concepts clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders
- [ ] You provide constructive feedback during code reviews
- [ ] You actively participate in meetings and contribute valuable insights

Project Management

You consistently meet deadlines and deliver on commitments
- [ ] You can accurately estimate the time and effort required for tasks
- [ ] You proactively communicate blockers and ask for help when needed
- [ ] You balance perfectionism with practicality to ship working software

Quality Assurance
- [ ] You write comprehensive tests for your code
- [ ] You consider security implications in your implementations
- [ ] You follow deployment and version control best practices
- [ ] You monitor and maintain the software you've built

## Growth Mindset
Continuous Learning
- [ ] You actively seek feedback and use it to improve
- [ ] You learn from mistakes rather than repeating them
- [ ] You mentor junior developers and learn from senior colleagues
- [ ] You contribute to open source projects or maintain side projects

Business Awareness
- [ ] You understand how your technical work contributes to business goals
- [ ] You can prioritize features based on user impact and business value
- [ ] You consider the total cost of ownership for your technical decisions

Areas for Improvement

If you're unsure about your abilities, focus on developing:
- [ ] Communication skills - Practice explaining your work clearly
- [ ] Testing practices - Increase test coverage and learn testing frameworks
- [ ] Code review participation - Both giving and receiving feedback constructively
- [ ] System design - Understanding how individual components fit into larger architectures
- [ ] Domain knowledge - Learning the business context of the software you build

Different Levels of Excellence
Remember that being "good" exists on a spectrum:
- [ ] Junior level: Writes working code with guidance, learns quickly, asks good questions
- [ ] Mid-level: Solves problems independently, mentors others, contributes to architecture decisions
- [ ] Senior level: Leads technical initiatives, influences engineering culture, makes strategic technology choices
